EDITED Aaltoliike Project 2015 at the [Habitare](https://habitare.messukeskus.com/) fair 9.-13.9.2015

The Block area Hall 7, Stand 7f1

Welcome to visit the Edited Aaltoliike Project exhibition of art pieces and design objects made out of upcycled books. Aaltoliike Project is a multidisciplinary course organised by the Department of Design in Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture. The international student group has sensitively interpreted book pages and given them new interesting meanings that are presented at the stand 7f1.

I participated in the student exhibition with my work [Ydin](@/artwork/other/2015-ydin/index.md)
