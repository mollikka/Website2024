On late summer evenings, the gnomes gather near a giant rock salt formation shaped like a boy to tell the tales of old forbidden places. To turn back is dangerous but to remember is vital. Every young gnome must learn that you cannot step in the same river twice.

{% comment(date='2024-03-10') %}
I dreamed of making music for years. I didn't have the right tools or resources or the routine, so I wasn't able to get anywhere.

I finally got started on a music path when a friend helped me with Reaper DAW basics. I immediately started making this first collection, working on it almost daily for months.

I felt great pride and joy when I finished this set. These days, I'd say Water Level is still worth a listen.
