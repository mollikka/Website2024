This is the harvest of a design idea that Iâ€™ve tried to grow since
[Kernel of Truth (2018)](@/artwork/patterns/2018-totuuden-siemen/index.md).
Along the way, parts of the idea was utilized in
[Pandemonium (2020)](@/artwork/design/2020-pandemonium/index.md)
and
[Hydra (2020)](@/artwork/design/2020-hydra/index.md).
Now it is ready to fill the plane.
