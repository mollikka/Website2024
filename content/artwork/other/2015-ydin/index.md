Ydin (2015) is an upcycled paper sculpture. I cut the pages of photoelectric conference proceedings with a paper knife and arranged them into seven sheets of roughly 80cm тип 80cm.

Ydin was on display at [Habitare 2015](https://habitare.messukeskus.com/) in Messukeskus, Helsinki as part of a student exhibition called Edited (Aaltoliike). Edited featured upcycled book art from 7 Aalto University students.
